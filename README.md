This encompasses what I've learned while self-studying Data Structures and Algorithms.

I've completed a LinkedIn Course, Python Data Structures and Algorithms. It was a fun course that introduced to me to some useful concepts. I learned about Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, the Depth First Search Algorithm, the Breadth First Search Algorithm, the A* Search Algorithm.
I'm currently doing a course on EDX, Algorithmic Design and Techniques by UC San Diego. 
I'm also looking through MIT's 6.002 course. Trust me, it's really hard. It's fun tho
